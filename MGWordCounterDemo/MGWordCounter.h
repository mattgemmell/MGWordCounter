/*
 NOTE: Instances of this class expect to be the delegate of a Text View
        (i.e. NSTextViewDelegate on OS X, or UITextViewDelegate on iOS),
        but MGWordCounter does NOT attempt to create this relationship itself.
 
        You should either set your MGWordCounter to be the delegate of the 
        relevant TextView, or alternatively you should forward the following
        (NS/UI)TextViewDelegate method calls from your actual TextView delegate:
        
        On Mac:
            - textView:shouldChangeTextInRange:replacementString:
            - textDidChange:
        
        On iOS:
            - textView:shouldChangeTextInRange:replacementText:
            - textViewDidChange:
 
        (As long as the expected information is provided to the above delegate 
        method, the only other method called on the TextView instance will be
        the -string method on OS X, or the -text method on iOS.)
 
        To support counting of the _selected_ text, you should also ensure that the
        MGWordCounter instance receives this (NS/UI)TextViewDelegate method:
        
        On Mac:
            - textView:willChangeSelectionFromCharacterRange:toCharacterRange:
                (The last parameter, unchanged, will be the return value.)
        
        On iOS:
            - textViewDidChangeSelection:

// The notification `object' is the sending MGWordCounter.

#define MGCountIsForSelection @"MGCountIsForSelection" // "MGCountIsForSelection" with an NSNumber (BOOL) value.
// Note: if MGCountIsForSelection is YES, then MGWordCount is the selection's word-count. If NO, MGWordCount is for the full text.
